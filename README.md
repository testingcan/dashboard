# Dashboard

Work in progress for a dashboard intended to be displayed
through a Raspberry Pi. 

## Use
Current implementation checks for trains departing from the
next station and displays the next three trains departing. 

Run `main.py` to run the application. Current application 
checks the time periodically and updates the displayed output.
